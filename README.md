# Tedd's Power BI Dashboard Portfolio

The project is my self-taught process of learning Power BI. Throughout this journey, I have learned many kinds of visualization, and how to use every single one for certain situations from practical analysis tasks. For example, scatter plots for investigating the correlation between two variables in the dataset or line plots for monitoring the trend line of a specific variable over time. Hopefully, I will soon use what I've learned so far in solving real-life problems.

# Featured Dashboards

## 📉 Data Jobs Dashboard (V1 - Comprehensive Exploration)

![Main Data Jobs Dashboard](/images/MainDashboard.png)

This initial dashboard provides a comprehensive two-page exploration of the **data job market**, designed for **job seekers**. It features a _high-level summary page_ and a _detailed drill-through page_ for specific job titles, offering a broad look at market trends and compensation.

**Key Power BI Skills Utilized:**

- Dashboard Layout & Design
- Power Query (ETL & Data Shaping)
- Basic Data Modeling (Table Relationships)
- Implicit Measures & Standard Aggregations
- Core Charts (Bar, Line, Area, Column)
- Map Visualizations for Geospatial Data
- KPI Cards & Detailed Data Tables
- Interactive Slicers for Filtering
- Buttons & Bookmarks for Page Navigation
- Drill-Through Functionality

## 📊 Data Jobs Dashboard 2.0 (V2 - Single-Page Focus)

![Drill Through Specified Job](/images/DrillThrough.png)
This Drill Through Specified Job page streamlines the analysis into a highly focused, single-page experience. It's optimized to deliver the most critical insights quickly to job seekers, featuring dynamic interactions and more advanced analytical capabilities.
